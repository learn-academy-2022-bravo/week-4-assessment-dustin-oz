# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React?

  Your answer: Props are a little like paramaters/arguments in regular JavaScript. Props stand for properties. Props are how we access pieces of React state in other components. If we assign a variable to a piece of state within the componenet call, we can then access that piece of state later on in another component by using the React keyword "props"


  Researched answer: Props are arguments passed into React components. Props are passed to components via html attributes and stands for properties.



2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer: A DOM event is how a developer affects change on a web page. An event could be a key press or lift, a mouse click or release as well as many other things.

  Researched answer: DOM events allow JavaScript to register various event handlers on various elements in an HTML page.



3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: In functional programming, data isn't be stored in objects, it is only manipulated by other functions. In OOP, we store data in Objects and instances of those objects.

  Researched answer: Functional programming is done by writing pure functions. It does not store data, it manipulates it. OOP, stores data as objects and instances of the objects.



4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer: In Ruby, an integer is a whole number and a Float is not. Floats contain decimal values.

  Researched answer: After researching a little, I would answer this particular question the same way. In Ruby, an integer is a whole number and a Float is not. Floats contain decimal values.



5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: Implicit return essentially means that in Ruby, the last line of a method is always returned whether you write in the return or not. Thus, if you write in no return, then it is implied or implicit that the line will be returned.

  Researched answer: Ruby methods always return the evaluated result of the last line of the expression unless an explicit return comes before it.
